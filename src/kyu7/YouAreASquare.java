/**DESCRIPTION
 * A square of squares
 * You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!
 *  However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! T
 *  hose blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it!
 *  You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

 Task
 Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:
 In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.
 The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

     Examples

     -1  =>  false
     0  =>  true
     3  =>  false
     4  =>  true
     25  =>  true
     26  =>  false
